# Object Detection Model using VOC 2012 Dataset

This repository contains code for an object detection model implemented using the PyTorch library with the VOC 2012 dataset and the Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) architecture.

## Dataset
The VOC 2012 dataset is utilized as the training and evaluation dataset. This dataset provides a wide range of images with annotated objects belonging to various categories.

## Data Augmentation
To enhance the model's performance and improve its ability to handle variations in real-world scenarios, the following data augmentation techniques are applied during the data preprocessing stage:

- Rotation: Random rotation of images to simulate different viewpoints.
- Scaling: Rescaling images to introduce variations in object sizes.
- Flipping: Horizontal flipping of images to account for mirror reflections.
- RandomCrop: Randomly cropping regions of images to introduce spatial diversity.

## Model Architecture
The object detection model is based on the SSD architecture, which is known for its efficiency and accuracy in detecting objects within images. The model is implemented using the PyTorch library, allowing for flexibility and ease of experimentation.

## Training and Evaluation
The training script included in this repository enables training the object detection model using the VOC 2012 dataset. It handles loading the dataset, initializing the model, defining the loss function, and optimizing the model parameters using gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent.

Model evaluation is performed using the Average Precision (AP) and Mean Average Precision (mAP) metrics. These metrics provide insights into the model's accuracy and effectiveness in detecting objects across multiple categories.

## AP and mAP Calculation
The implementation includes functionality to calculate the Average Precision (AP) and Mean Average Precision (mAP) metrics. These metrics help evaluate the object detection model's performance. The calculations are done based on the predicted bounding boxes and class labels compared to the ground truth annotations.
